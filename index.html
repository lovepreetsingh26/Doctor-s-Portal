    <h3>Hospitals in Derabassi, Chandigarh:</h3> <br>
    <h5>Some of the Most Important Services Provided by Them</h5> <br>
Most of the doctors have affiliations with at least one or more hospitals. All in all, hospitals in town are known to offer their patients a variety of services that mainly cover two main areas, one of which includes inpatient procedures that usually only require overnight stays. Another type of service offered by hospitals is known as outpatient services, which include operational procedures involving local anaesthesia or the use of some expensive diagnostic or surgical equipment. <br>

<h4>Which are the most important services provided by the hospitals?</h4><br>
Apart from the above mentioned two services, hospitals are also known to offer several other services. The most important services offered by most of the renowned hospitals around the country are mentioned here:
</section>
<section id="section3">
    <h4>1. Medical services</h4><br>

The basic medical services are offered at all kinds of hospitals, be it small or large, government or private. These services also become a part of the various different hospital departments where clear cut lines cannot be drawn to differentiate between specific procedures. Consultations are readily available at all kinds of hospitals, and general medical facilities including stitching, cleaning up a wound, glucose bottles etc are some things available at all hospitals, as well as some of the doctor clinics. <br>

<h4>2. Surgical facilities</h4><br>

Surgical services are what differentiates medical hospitals from doctors’ clinics. In a general hospital, the different branches of surgical services are usually combined into a single department. One of the most systematic departments of a hospital, the surgical services include all the operations, diagnostic and therapeutic departments, combined in one to function as a single operating unit. Hospitals stock all kinds of surgical tools that can be used for outpatient services. Special hospitals are also well stocked with specific surgical tools and machines that are used for in-depth surgical procedures such as heart surgeries, transplants, repairing broken bones, etc. <br>

<h4>3. Emergency care</h4><br>
All the hospitals essentially offer its patients an emergency care unit for special kinds of treatments. Emergency care units in the hospital are responsible to care for the traumatic and other serious conditions that patients may go through. The staff at the emergency care unit are trained to mollify the patients, until and unless they are ready to be moved to another room for the actual treatment or diagnosis. <br>

<h4>4. Maternity Care</h4>

This usually is a separate department in the hospitals, and is also popularly known as a maternity home or a maternity hospital. However, big hospitals have a special and dedicated department with them that solely looks after all the required maternity care essentials. Most hospitals have special rooms that are dedicated to childbirth. Certain hospitals Derabassi, Chandigarh has also have all inclusive rooms where mothers can nurse their babies and recover from the delivery for a few days’ period. Hospitals can also make use of operative rooms in order to assist women in childbirth, apart from the, newborn intensive care facilities that are available at most of the reputed hospitals. This special facility is available for babies that are born prematurely or are born with a serious problem. <br>

<h4>5. Laboratory services</h4><br>

Most of the hospitals employ trained staff professionals to look after some of the most essential services in a hospital. All the important tests that are required for the diagnosis are done at these laboratories. All the major hospitals have laboratory services on their premises. The personnel working here are also trained in drawing blood from a patient in the least painful manner. For all the small hospitals that don’t have enough space for laboratories, they usually get all their essential tests outsourced from the existing lab services available in the nearby area. <br>

<h4>6. Nursing homes</h4> <br>

A nursing home is a place that is specially designed for patients who need constant care but are not actually required to get admitted for it. Nursing homes are often associated with senior patients, but in actuality, its services are open to all the patients who require this very level of care. All the major hospitals in town have a nursing home unit in the premises. They cater to a 24-hour service facility and are under the care of a medical person round the clock. <br>

<h4>7. Special services</h4> <br>

The medical arena is very large, and so not many hospitals, no matter how huge they are, can provide A to Z medical facilities to their patients. So most of the hospitals offer special services to their patients in the form of cardiology wards, cancer centres, rehabilitation units, etc. Patients can also avail ongoing treatments in the form of outpatient services through a hospital run clinic along with offering surgical and various other services in the same facility. <br>
